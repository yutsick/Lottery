## Install
1. `npm install` to install dev dependencies
2. `gulp watch` to compile and watch for changes
    1. (You can also use `gulp --production` to compile assets for production, minify etc.)
3. A new browser window/tab will open


## Code recommendations
* Prefix JS-utilities classes with a "js-" in the HTML. E.g. ".js-toggle-navigation".
* Don't repeat yourself. Bootstrap ships with a lot of premade components. Reuse when possible.
